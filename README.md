# Database_Engine

This assignment includes two parts:
1. Implement indexes on top of CSV data in CSVDataTable implementations.
- Perform the following operations on CSVDataTable and test:
	- insert
	- find_by_template
	- delete_by_template
	- add_index
	- import_data
	- save()
	- load()
2. Query optimization:
- Add a JOIN function to the CSVDataTable and implement query optimizations.
- Use Access Paths based on index selection to optimize find_by_template() and join().
